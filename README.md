#  ShareFiles

This is a P2P File Sharing Android application created using Android Studio 3.0. Each device acts as a peer and one of them will act as tracker server. The peers download files through the tracker server. A tracker server keeps a list of files available for every peer to download from. Tracker server is responsible for smooth incoming/outgoing transition of the peers in the network. While downloading of the files is in progress, if the serving peer leaves the network abruptly, the downloading will be stopped gracefully. Tracker server updates each peer with the available files list in the network.
The download starts when a peer updates its MasterList with file names to be downloaded from the MasterList of the tracker. User interface will also indicate the user the progress of the file download. The peer will download the file in multiple chunks simultaneously from the source.
